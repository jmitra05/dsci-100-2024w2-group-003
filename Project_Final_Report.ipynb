    "A UBC Computer Science research group is studying how people play video games, focusing on Minecraft. They set up a Minecraft server to track player actions. The data is divided into two sets: players.csv and sessions.csv. The players.csv data set has 7 variables and 194 observations. Contrarily, the sessions.csv data set has 5 variables and 1533 observations. Some potential issues with these data sets are that they are not very human readable, some players have played 0 hour, hashedEmail columns are extremely hard to read, as they are just a long sequence of numbers and letters, in the sessions.csv data set, it is very unclear what the original_start_time and original_end_time columns represent, the start_time and end_time columns have 2 observations in each cell, making the data untidy, finally there are multiple players in the players.csv data set that have player 0 hours, causing issues when trying to create visuals for this data. The question we tried to answer in our project was if a player's playtime (played_hours), experience level (experience), and number of sessions (number_of_sessions) predict their likelihood of subscribing to the newsletter (subscribe)? played_hours, experience, and number_of_sessions are key factors in predicting whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter. played_hours measures overall engagement, experience indicates skill level and familiarity with the game, and number_of_sessions reflects playing habits. Preparing the data involves scaling numerical values, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing data to ensure the model can accurately identify patterns and make reliable predictions."
